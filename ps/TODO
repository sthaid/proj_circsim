--- H Bridge ---

An H bridge is an electronic circuit that enables a voltage to be applied across a load in 
opposite direction. These circuits are often used in robotics and other applications to allow 
DC motors to run forwards or backwards.  Most DC-to-AC converters (power inverters), 
most AC/AC converters, the DC-to-DC push–pull converter, most motor controllers, and many other 
kinds of power electronics use H bridges. In particular, a bipolar stepper motor is almost 
invariably driven by a motor controller containing two H bridges.

1) N and P channel semiconductors
  A solid-state H bridge is typically constructed using opposite polarity devices, such as 
  PNP bipolar junction transistors (BJT) or P-channel MOSFETs connected to the high voltage 
  bus and NPN BJTs or N-channel MOSFETs connected to the low voltage bus

2) N channel-only semiconductors
  The most efficient MOSFET designs use N-channel MOSFETs on both the high side and low side 
  because they typically have a third of the ON resistance of P-channel MOSFETs. This requires a 
  more complex design since the gates of the high side MOSFETs must be driven positive with 
  respect to the DC supply rail. Many integrated circuit MOSFET gate drivers include a charge 
  pump within the device to achieve this.

3) Variants
  A common variation of this circuit uses just the two transistors on one side of the load, 
  similar to a class AB amplifier. Such a configuration is called a "half bridge". 
  The half bridge is used in some switched-mode power supplies that use synchronous rectifiers 
  and in switching amplifiers. The half-H bridge type is commonly abbreviated to "Half-H" to 
  distinguish it from full ("Full-H") H bridges. Another common variation, adding a third 
  'leg' to the bridge, creates a three-phase inverter. The three-phase inverter is the core 
  of any AC motor drive.

--- MOSFETS ---

If the MOSFET is an n-channel or nMOS FET, then   
  the source and drain are n+ regions and the body is a p region. 
    (xxx I guess this is like NPN BJT)

If the MOSFET is a p-channel or pMOS FET, then 
  the source and drain are p+ regions and the body is a n region.
    (xxx I guess this is like PNP BJT)

Drain is connected to the heat sink.

Should fuse protect the inverter circuit.

--- IGBT ---

An insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) is a three-terminal power semiconductor device primarily 
used as an electronic switch which, as it was developed, came to combine high efficiency and fast 
switching. It consists of four alternating layers (P-N-P-N) that are controlled by a metal-oxide-semiconductor 
(MOS) gate structure without regenerative action. Although the structure of the IGBT is topologically 
the same as a thyristor with a MOS gate (MOS gate thyristor), the thyristor action is completely 
suppressed and only the transistor action is permitted in the entire device operation range. 
It switches electric power in many applications: variable-frequency drives (VFDs), electric cars, 
trains, variable speed refrigerators, lamp ballasts, air-conditioners and even stereo systems 
with switching amplifiers.

--- Why NPN transistor is more preferred over PNP? ---

Almost every other answer says NPN transistors are preferred because of faster mobility of 
electrons. However for circuit designer like me, NPN transistor is preferred because it is 
most suitable for negative ground system.

    680M  T3M     <=== 680M means 68pf 20%

  These caps are not good enough.

Make my own

  - needs 10 diodes,  at least 10KV rating
  - need  10 diodes, approx 15000pf each
    . I found hvstuff.com which has good price 10KV caps 4700pf;
      using these need three times number of caps - TOTAL = 30
  - circsim file is vm5x_hf 
     . input                          :   4kv @ 20kHz

http://www.explainthatstuff.com/howtransistorswork.html    TRANSISTORS / FETS
  nice diagrams here

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#Simplified_operation      TRANSISTORS / FETS
  The field-effect transistor, sometimes called a unipolar transistor, uses either electrons 
  (in n-channel FET) or holes (in p-channel FET) for conduction. The four terminals of the FET 
  are named source, gate, drain, and body (substrate). On most FETs, the body is connected to 
  the source inside the package, and this will be assumed for the following description.

  In a FET, the drain-to-source current flows via a conducting channel that connects the 
  source region to the drain region. The conductivity is varied by the electric field that 
  is produced when a voltage is applied between the gate and source terminals; hence the 
  current flowing between the drain and source is controlled by the voltage applied between 
  the gate and source.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFET         MOSFETS
  In field effect transistors (FETs), depletion mode and enhancement mode are two major 
  transistor types, corresponding to whether the transistor is in an ON state or an OFF 
  state at zero gate–source voltage.

  Enhancement-mode MOSFETs are the common switching elements in most MOS. These devices 
  are off at zero gate–source voltage.

  Enhancement-mode MOSFETs are the common switching elements in most MOS. These devices 
  are off at zero gate–source voltage, NMOS and can be turned on by pulling the gate voltage 
  higher than the source voltage, PMOS can be turned on by pulling the gate voltage lower 
  than the source voltage. In most circuits, this means pulling an enhancement-mode 
  MOSFET's gate voltage towards its drain voltage turns it ON

  Refer to Circuit Symbols section.

- N channel MOSFET
- enhancement mode
- integrated free wheel diode ???
