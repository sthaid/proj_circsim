--- H Bridge ---

An H bridge is an electronic circuit that enables a voltage to be applied across a load in 
opposite direction. These circuits are often used in robotics and other applications to allow 
DC motors to run forwards or backwards.  Most DC-to-AC converters (power inverters), 
most AC/AC converters, the DC-to-DC push–pull converter, most motor controllers, and many other 
kinds of power electronics use H bridges. In particular, a bipolar stepper motor is almost 
invariably driven by a motor controller containing two H bridges.

1) N and P channel semiconductors
  A solid-state H bridge is typically constructed using opposite polarity devices, such as 
  PNP bipolar junction transistors (BJT) or P-channel MOSFETs connected to the high voltage 
  bus and NPN BJTs or N-channel MOSFETs connected to the low voltage bus

2) N channel-only semiconductors
  The most efficient MOSFET designs use N-channel MOSFETs on both the high side and low side 
  because they typically have a third of the ON resistance of P-channel MOSFETs. This requires a 
  more complex design since the gates of the high side MOSFETs must be driven positive with 
  respect to the DC supply rail. Many integrated circuit MOSFET gate drivers include a charge 
  pump within the device to achieve this.

3) Variants
  A common variation of this circuit uses just the two transistors on one side of the load, 
  similar to a class AB amplifier. Such a configuration is called a "half bridge". 
  The half bridge is used in some switched-mode power supplies that use synchronous rectifiers 
  and in switching amplifiers. The half-H bridge type is commonly abbreviated to "Half-H" to 
  distinguish it from full ("Full-H") H bridges. Another common variation, adding a third 
  'leg' to the bridge, creates a three-phase inverter. The three-phase inverter is the core 
  of any AC motor drive.

--- MOSFETS ---

If the MOSFET is an n-channel or nMOS FET, then   
  the source and drain are n+ regions and the body is a p region. 
  - the gate is positive relative to source

If the MOSFET is a p-channel or pMOS FET, then 
  the source and drain are p+ regions and the body is a n region.
  - the gate is negative relative to source

Drain is connected to the heat sink.

--- IGBT ---

An insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) is a three-terminal power semiconductor device primarily 
used as an electronic switch which, as it was developed, came to combine high efficiency and fast 
switching. It consists of four alternating layers (P-N-P-N) that are controlled by a metal-oxide-semiconductor 
(MOS) gate structure without regenerative action. Although the structure of the IGBT is topologically 
the same as a thyristor with a MOS gate (MOS gate thyristor), the thyristor action is completely 
suppressed and only the transistor action is permitted in the entire device operation range. 
It switches electric power in many applications: variable-frequency drives (VFDs), electric cars, 
trains, variable speed refrigerators, lamp ballasts, air-conditioners and even stereo systems 
with switching amplifiers.

--- Why NPN transistor is more preferred over PNP? ---

Almost every other answer says NPN transistors are preferred because of faster mobility of 
electrons. However for circuit designer like me, NPN transistor is preferred because it is

--- Calculating Number of Wraps ---

First get inductance as a function of wraps:
   http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/magnetic/indtor.html
      Toroid Radius    4.2 cm
      Area             2.7 cm2
      Ui               2200
      Turns            20    1.13 mH
                       25    1.76
                       30    2.5
                       40    4.5
                       50    7.1

   Tested with 20 wraps on my toroid, and measured 1.25 mH,
   which is quite close to the value calculated above.

Choose a desired primary current for when there is no load on secondary:
  XL = 2*pi*f*L
  IL = Vrms / XL  
          Vrms  
  IL = ----------
       (2*pi*f*L)

         Vrms
  L = -----------
      (2*pi*f*IL)

           1000 
  L = -----------------
      (6.3 * 30000 * 3)

  L = 1.7 mH   at 30khz , 3A
  this is about 25 turns   <=====

I bought 20 meters of secondary wire, and wound the toroid secondary
  . 1 Turn on the Toroid is about 2.66 inches, for the first layer
  . Assuming an average of 3 inches per wrap, 20 meters is about 260 wraps.
  . Measured 160 mH
  . Prior measurent for 20 wraps is 1.25 mH
  . Estimate of number secondary wraps
         sqrt(160 / 1.25) * 20   ===>  226 wraps

So, I'm hoping for 10x transformer.  
  . Primary should be 23 wraps, which is consistent with the 3 amps 
    calculated above.

Conclusion
  . Primary  23 wraps
  . Secondary 226 wraps
  . Primary current, at 30khz, no load on secondary is a bit more than 3A

Length of Primary wire
  1 wrap = 4.33 inches
  length = 99 inches for wraps    4.33 x 23
           24  extra
          ----
          123"   = 10.3 ft    or 10 ft 4 inches

   After wrapping primary, measured inductance:
     - primary            1.62 mhH
     - secondary is now   152 mH     (it was 160mH before winding the primary)

Test Results
  Input to Transformer       Output from HF VM        Factor

http://www.explainthatstuff.com/howtransistorswork.html    TRANSISTORS / FETS
  nice diagrams here

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#Simplified_operation      TRANSISTORS / FETS
  The field-effect transistor, sometimes called a unipolar transistor, uses either electrons 
  (in n-channel FET) or holes (in p-channel FET) for conduction. The four terminals of the FET 
  are named source, gate, drain, and body (substrate). On most FETs, the body is connected to 
  the source inside the package, and this will be assumed for the following description.

  In a FET, the drain-to-source current flows via a conducting channel that connects the 
  source region to the drain region. The conductivity is varied by the electric field that 
  is produced when a voltage is applied between the gate and source terminals; hence the 
  current flowing between the drain and source is controlled by the voltage applied between 
  the gate and source.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFET         MOSFETS
  In field effect transistors (FETs), depletion mode and enhancement mode are two major 
  transistor types, corresponding to whether the transistor is in an ON state or an OFF 
  state at zero gate–source voltage.

  Enhancement-mode MOSFETs are the common switching elements in most MOS. These devices 
  are off at zero gate–source voltage.

  Enhancement-mode MOSFETs are the common switching elements in most MOS. These devices 
  are off at zero gate–source voltage, NMOS and can be turned on by pulling the gate voltage 
  higher than the source voltage, PMOS can be turned on by pulling the gate voltage lower 
  than the source voltage. In most circuits, this means pulling an enhancement-mode 
  MOSFET's gate voltage towards its drain voltage turns it ON

TITLE: THEORY - REACTANCE and IMPEDANCE
=================================

Inductive reactance is a property exhibited by an inductor, and inductive reactance exists based 
on the fact that an electric current produces a magnetic field around it. In the context of an AC 
circuit (although this concept applies any time current is changing), this magnetic field is constantly 
changing as a result of current that oscillates back and forth. It is this change in magnetic field 
that induces another electric current to flow in the same wire, in a direction such as to oppose the 
flow of the current originally responsible for producing the magnetic field (known as Lenz's Law). 
Hence, inductive reactance is an opposition to the change of current through an element.

Capacitive and Inductive Reactance ...
  XC = -1 / (2*pi*f*C)
  XL = 2*pi*f*L

And Current through an inductor with AC RMS Voltage A
  IL = A / XL  = A / (2*pi*f*L)

--- Impedance ---
Z = R + jX

When both a capacitor and an inductor are placed in series in a circuit, their contributions 
to the total circuit impedance are opposite. Capacitive reactance and inductive reactance 
contribute to the total reactance as follows
  X = 2pi*f*L - 1/(2*pi*f*C)
Setting this to 0 means the circuit has no Reactance, and thus no average current. Giving
the resonant frequency.

Notes on One of the Chirk Schematics
------------------------------------
- capacitor calculations  (3rd cap may need to experiment with)
   . 20khz,  is 50us period;   half the period is 25us
   . T = R * C     R = 1000 ohms based on 1000V at 1A
   . C = T / R   = 25e-6 / 1000 = 25e-9  = 25nf
   . since larger is probably better, try  1uf
   . caps 598-941C20W1KF  1uf 2000vdc   $12
