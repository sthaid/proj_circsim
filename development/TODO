====================  TODO NEXT  ============================================

work the xxx issues in *.c

merge all doc into 

documentation
- readme.md and design files
- add copyright notices

regression test

start taking notes for fusor power supply, and check those in too

====================  TODO LOWER PRIORITY  ===================================

lc1 test should test with a power source or some better method than software precharge

====================  SOME REJECTED IDEAS  ===================================

consider reversing the gridloc A3  ->  3A
  - algebraic chess is    a b c d e f g h
                        8      etc
  - theater seating is a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9
                       b
                       c

set params on the command line

should model worry about summing the current on the ground node and/or 
current return to the power supply

redesign control pane, maybe don't need delta_t, and could put controls on top

add capability to adjust component values while model is running

debug param to enable prints

delete DCPWR_RAMP

evaluate use of assert vs FATAL, could make my ASSERT
    #define ASSERT(cond) \
        do { \
            if ((cond) == false) { \
                ERROR("ASSERTION FAILED %s, func=%s file=%s line=%d\n", #cond, __func__, __FILE__, __LINE__); \
                exit(1); \
            } \
        } while (0)
