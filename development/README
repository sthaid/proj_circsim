gen_resistor_grid: this program generates the infinitie 1ohm resistor grid in file test/r3

model_test1: this program models a simple R-C-R circuit; lessons learned have been 
    incorporated in model.c

model_test2: similar to model_test1, but this program models a simple R-R-R circuit

moving_average_test: unit test for moving average utils that are now in util_misc.c

diode_ohms.jpg: graph of the equation used in model.c to simulate diode resistance
    y = exp(50*(.7-x))
