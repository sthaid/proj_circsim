RESISTOR TESTS
======================

r1: two circuits, each with own DC power; first circuit is series, second is series parallel

r2: same as first circuit from r1, except component power is displayed

r3: almost infinite grid of 1 ohm resistors

r4: unusual combination of 3 series resistors, 100M--1ohm--100M;
    PROBLEM: this takes a long time to stabilize, and a single model step 
             is not adequate when the circuit_is_stable routine's MAX_COUNT
             is set to 1000000
