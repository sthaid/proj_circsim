RESISTOR TESTS
======================

r1: two circuits, each with own DC power; first circuit is series, second is series parallel

r2: same as first circuit from r1, except component power is displayed

r3: almost infinite grid of 1 ohm resistors

r4: unusual combination of 3 series resistors, 100M--1ohm--100M;
    PROBLEM: this fails to stabilize; and a single model step 
             is not adequate when the circuit_is_stable routine's MAX_COUNT
             is set to 1000000

======================
RESISTOR CAPACITOR TESTS
======================

The time constant of an RC circuit is T = R*C. Where T is the time that it takes
for the capacitor to charge to 63.2% of the DC voltage. The 63.2% equals 1 - exp(-1).

rc1: simple RC circuit with T=1

rc2: same T=1 as rc1, however this circuit has 2 series resistors and 2 parallel
     capacitors

rc3: similar to rc2, but with just one capacitor

rc4: two simple capacitor circuits, both with T=1; testing different combinations
     of resistor values

rc5: another T=1 circuit, this time with 3 resistors and 2 capacitors in series

rc6: similar to rc5 but with the components in different order

rc7: unusual combination  100Mohm--0.5mf--100Mohm, with T=100000secs;
     PROBLEM similar to r4, does not stabilize for the first couple seconds;
             however when run for 100000s the result is correct

======================
RESISTOR INDUCTOR TESTS
======================

Time constant = L / R

rl1: simple resistor inductor circuit with T=10ms

rl2: similar to rl1, but with 2 inductors in parallel; T=10ms

rl3: 2 series resistors and 2 parallel inductors; T=10ms

rl4: 2 series resistors and 2 series inductors; T=10ms

INDUCTOR CAPACITOR TESTS
======================

                              1
resonant frequency =  -------------------
                       2 * PI * sqrt(L*C)

lc1: simply a capacitor and inductor, the model precharges the inductor with
     one amp; frequency=100hz

======================
DIODE TESTS
======================

d1: DC power, single resistor and diode

d2: AC power, single resistor and diode

d3: AC power high voltage and high frequency, single resistor and diode

d4: AC power, 2 resistors and a diode

d5: DC power, 3 resistors and a diode

d6: AC power, resistor, and 2 series diodes

d7: AC power, resistor, 2 series diodes, resistor

d8: AC power, diode and capacitor

d9: AC power, diode - capacitor - diode
    PROBLEM: fails to stabilize

d10: AC power, diode - resistor - diode
     PROBLEM: fails to stabilize
