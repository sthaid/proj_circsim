PARAMS
- flag if the param must be set when model is reset
     set_only_when_model_state_reset
- update counter for each param
- routine to set params, and updates the counter
- can't change certain params when model is running


model read delta_t and dcpwr param at run start
 - and not updating these when running
 - still update stop_t when running

new form for delta_t param, examples
    1ms   
    Xms,ramp_up    ramps up to Xms - how long to ramp up
   
reverse colors, so scren can be printed

redesign display to hold graphs

optimize model computations
  - and check with profiling

XXX issues

model cont display button should allow model to continue after stop_t reached

ac simple circuit
   power / capacitor
   verify 90 dgrees

XXX issues

verify cmd

other component stuff to track
  - power
  - energy

----  model ----

fix T5, compare to T13

create an automated test suite

---- later ---

don't allow mulitple remote connection to same gridloc

optimization, and multi threads, change O0 to O2

try again to use capacitor for battery, and to evaluate ground current

-----------------   CODED or DONE  --------------

sdl_create_texture should be called prior to fontsize call
SDL prints
val_to_str  picoseconds

checkins
review this file
shorten param names so they fit better
cap / inductor oscillator test
use #define to select long double

clean up common.h,   fields such as i_prior_prior, etc

------------------  MAYBE ?? ----------------------

could have an impulse power supply to test resonant frequency of LC;
it would quickly ramp up and then isolate

debug param to enable prints
