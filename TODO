clean up the test scripts

try a single test with 2 or 3 circurits,  LC, RC, RL
and with 3 graphs

scope ...
- need a better way to trigger the scope
- validate scope params in main.c
- check time params for > 0

add diode

XXX issues

====================  NEXT  =================================================

use of assert vs FATAL, could make my ASSERT

optimize model computations
  - and check with profiling
  - if there are performance issues use profiling;
  - optimization, and multi threads, change O0 to O2

====================  LOWER  ================================================

clean up tests and make a good suite of tests

update DOCUMENTATION

model cont display button should allow model to continue after stop_t reached

should model worry about summing the current on the ground node and/or 
current return to the power supply

verify model is stable

LC circuit decay
- try smaller delta_t;  this helps with LC problem

====================  FOR CONSIDERATION  ====================================

other component stuff to track
  - power
  - energy

debug param to enable prints

init prior voltage on power up, delta_t==0
  this could be done first call to get_comp_power following model_reset

consider reversing the gridloc A3  ->  3A
  - algebraic chess is    a b c d e f g h
                        8      etc

====================  DONE  =================================================

display the time in xxx.xxxxxxs
also display the stop_t
   RUNNING    123.456789s
   STOP_T     xxx.xxxxxxs
   RESET      CONT      STEP
model run xxxx.xxxx
model cont x.xxx  OR 1ms
    don't use plus, it is always a delta
val_to_str for secs does xxx.xxxxxxs

way to init inductor with current

reverse colors, so scren can be printed

draw double wide x/y axis
1G
aliasing problem, draw min and max

scope ...
- graph current
- more options on the set scope_a cmd
   - scope_a,b,c,d   current|voltage,ymin,ymax,gl,gl    (or gl,gnd    or gnd,gl   or just gl)

ac simple circuit
   power / capacitor
   verify current is 90 dgrees

delta_t ramp up
- finish coding this
- how many steps is it currently doing
