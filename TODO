NEW COMMANDS
=============

ISSUES
------
direction of current and voltage displayed at meters and scopes
  - could label components with dots when meter or scope is attached
          what colors for the dots, don't want RED or GREEN
when modify a component can the model be kept going
  - perhaps if the model is running then the component can adjust gradually, say ove 100 iterations;
    otherwise when the model is not running the component would be set immedeately
what limit to place on delta_t_us, considering the component adjust time, and the frequency
  of power supplies;   other dynamic considerations would be left to the user
how to lable power supplies on the display

not sure if I should be using comp_id in user intfc

HOW TO GET THERE
----------------

CURRENTS

- params
delta_t_us    1
current       on off
voltage       on off 
grid          on off
commpnoent    id value off
center        A1
scale         200

- larger size points in util_sdl.c

- keep track of term current in nodes
   - pre or post compute the currents through each node


- support routines to convert values to/from strings    STARTED ON THIS

- think about updates to the model to support capacitors, 

- run the model not fastr than real time

- scale font 


---- DONE  ---
- identify components  R1, C1, ...
    - add to component_t
- add gridlocstr to each gridloc
- rename model

- don't need the power supply value displayed on the grid, but may need to identify the power supply
  on the display somehow    DONE

- pass full args to each cmd    DONE

- use strings for params, the value can have spaces    DONE

- display grid coords at every point    DONE

- add center and scale params    DONE

- add the center cmd     DONE


- model support for value adjustment

---- MORE TODO -------

- add the modify cmd,  and add general way to gradual adjust components
    when the model is running;  how to know if the model is running

- make a routine in display.c to create the string that is displayed 
    start by displaying xxxxx if these values not yet supported
         // XXX make routines to return ohms_str volts_str, etc
         // XXX option to display currents instead of or in addition to comp values

- add new panes for the meters and scopes
   - add meter cmd, 
   - add scope cmd
   - also display component v,i,p, etc

- update show cmd to show the new stuff

- disable utils_predefinded_ graph mouse controls

- misc
  - better make_component_str, include units

- need more tests, such as
  - series/parallel resistors
  - infinite resistor array
  - resistor / capacitor time constant
  - capacitor / inductor resonant circuit
  - ac signal to capacitor, demonstrate zero energy on the power supply


LIST OR NEW CMDS
------------------
center 
modify
meter 
scope
trigger

center
------

center
  resets display to default center and zoom

set cmd : - use strings for param names and values
-------------------------------------------------

set delta_t_us      number
set grid            on|off
set display         comp_id|comp_current|comp_value 
set center          A26
set zoom            100

modify  cmd  - changes a component value   XXX can this be done while model is running?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

modify 7 value1 value2 ...
  if model is running then initiate a gradual adjust, otherwide immedeate

meter cmd
---------

meter A 7  ????
meter A a1 a2
meter A a1 ground
meter A off
  display red and black dots on components

scope cmd and trigger cmd
-----------------------

scope B 7 current xscale=xxx yscale=xxx yoffset=xxx
  display red and black dots on components
    OR
scope B voltage
scope B xscale=xxx 
scope B yscale=xxx
scope B yoffset=xxx
scope B off

trigger B

show cmd 
--------

args:
  help
  params
  component N
  components
  ground
  center
  meters
  scopes

NOTES:
-------

METER display example
   power_7  V=xxx I=xxx P=xxx E=xxx
   resistor_8  V=xxx I=xxx        XXX  need the direction

1 watt-second == 1 joule


LATER
-----

better help, and include cmd categories

FROM DIDPLAY.C
---------------

// XXX make routines to return ohms_str volts_str, etc
// XXX option to display currents instead of or in addition to comp values
// XXX don't need the power supply value displayed on the grid, in the status pane would be fine
// XXX display power supply current in status pane
// XXX cmd to center the display

rename compid to comp_id throughout
    
be able to see power supply power and energy; through a capacitor circuit

better unit printing strings for ohms, farads, etc
clean up so far
center cmd
select to display current of component values
zoom display increased range, and reduce font size

slew power supply or other components
display power supply in status pane,
 - especially want to see current
 - other ways possible, such as mouse hover
clean up test pgms
 - use 2 tests for infinite grid
add support for capacitor and test pgm
  for cap time constant
